The results differ from the main experimenst in that they use SAR input bands (vv and vh) for backbones with those bands. Additionally, the best performance is selected between between multi-modal (Sentinel1 + Sentinel2) results and Sentinel2 only results.", "Comments on new models in submission": "Describe any new models you have included which were not previously part of the leaderboard", "New model info": [{"model_display_name": "", "model_size": "", "unique_backbone_key": ""}]}

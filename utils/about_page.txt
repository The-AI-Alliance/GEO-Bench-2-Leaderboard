### 1. Create New Submission Directory
Create a new folder in the `new_submission` top directory:
```bash
geobench_leaderboard/
└── new_submission/
    ├── results_and_parameters.csv
    ├── additional_info.json
```

### 2. Add Results and Parameters Details

Add a CSV file (`results_and_parameters.csv`) with the columns below. Please note that if terratorch-iterate is used for experiments, this table may be created automatically upon completion of an experiment. Please see https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/GEO-Bench-Leaderboard for more:
 - `backbone`: backbone used for experiment, (e.g. Prithvi-EO-V2 600M)
 - `dataset`: some or all of the GEO-bench datasets. Please see Info page to learn more.
 - `Metric`: the type of metric used for evaluation. Depending on the dataset, this may be one of the following: `Overall_Accuracy`, `Multilabel_F1_Score`, `Multiclass_Jaccard_Index`
 - `experiment_name`: if terratorch-iterate used, this will the experiment_name used in mlflow. Otherwise, a unique name may be used for all results relating to a single backbone
 - `batch_size_selection`: denotes whether the batch size was fixed during hyperparameter optimization. May be `fixed` or `optimized`
 - `early_stop_patience`: early stopping patience using for trainer
 - `n_trials`: number of trials used for hyperparameter optimization
 - `Seed`: random seed used for repeated experiment. 10 random seeds must be used for each 
 - `batch_size`: batch size used for repeated experiments for each backbone/dataset combination.
 - `weight_decay`: weight decay experiments for each backbone/dataset combination.
 - `lr`: learning rate used for repeated experiments for each backbone/dataset combination. Obtained from hyperparameter optimization (HPO)
 - `test metric`: metric obtained from running backbone on the dataset during repeated experiment. Please see Info page to learn more. 



### 3. Add Additional Information
Create a JSON file (`additional_info.json`) with information about your submission and any new models that will be included.
The JSON file MUST have the same file name and contain the same keys as the `examples/additional_info.json` file. 


### 4. Submit PR

1. Fork the repository
